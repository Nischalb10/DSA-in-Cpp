Solution Approach
-----------------

The solution uses a simple approach to iterate through the list of points and compute the time taken to travel from one point to the next.

The code provided employs a function `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` under a `Solution` class. This function makes use of a list comprehension along with the built-in Python function `sum` to accumulate a total.

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of what the given solution does:

1.  The function `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` accepts a list of points, where each point is itself a list containing the x and y coordinates.

2.  The `max(abs(p1[0] - p2[0]), abs(p1[1] - p2[1]))` expression calculates the time required to move from point `p1` to point `p2`. This uses the concept that moving diagonally is equivalent to moving one unit horizontally and one unit vertically, hence the time to move diagonally is equal to the maximum of the horizontal and vertical distances.

    -   `abs(p1[0] - p2[0])` computes the absolute difference between the x coordinates of `p1` and `p2`.
    -   `abs(p1[1] - p2[1])` does the same for the y coordinates.
    -   `max(...)` then takes the larger of the two distances to find out how many seconds it would take to travel from `p1` to `p2`.
3.  The `pairwise(points)` function (which is likely assumed to be a custom or externally defined function that generates consecutive pairs of elements from the `points` list) is used to iterate through each pair of points in the order they appear.

4.  For each tuple `(p1, p2)` where `p1` and `p2` are consecutive points, the aforementioned max expression calculates the required time to move from `p1` to `p2`.

5.  The `sum` function adds together all the individual times calculated for moving between pairs of points, and this total represents the minimum time to visit all points in order.

The use of list comprehension along with `sum` makes for concise and efficient code. The underlying algorithm relies on the observation that, thanks to the rules of movement on the 2D plane, the time to move from one point to another is determined by the greater of the horizontal and vertical distances. By calculating and summing these times for each consecutive pair of points, the total travel time is found.


Time and Space Complexity
-------------------------

The time complexity of the code is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of points. This is because the function iterates over `n-1` pairs of points (since each point is visited after the previous one, except for the first point which does not follow another point), and for each pair, it calculates the maximum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which is done in constant time.

The space complexity of the code is `O(1)`. This is due to the fact that the sum is computed as the numbers are generated, and the extra space used does not grow with the input size. The variables `p1` and `p2` do not use additional space relative to the number of points because they are just references to the existing points in the input list.
