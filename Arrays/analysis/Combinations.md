Approach
========

This is based on Python. Other might be different a bit.

1.  Create an empty list `res` to store the final combinations and an empty list `comb` to store the current combination being formed.

2.  Define a recursive function `backtrack(start)`, which will generate all possible combinations of size `k` from the numbers starting from `start` up to `n`.

3.  In the `backtrack` function:

    -   If the length of `comb` becomes equal to `k`, it means we have formed a valid combination, so we append a copy of the current `comb` list to the `res` list. We use `comb[:]` to create a copy of the list since lists are mutable in Python, and we want to preserve the combination at this point without being modified later.

    -   If the length of `comb` is not equal to `k`, we continue the recursion.

4.  Within the `backtrack` function, use a loop to iterate over the numbers starting from `start` up to `n`.

    -   For each number `num` in the range, add it to the current `comb` list to form the combination.

    -   Make a recursive call to `backtrack` with `start` incremented by 1. This ensures that each number can only be used once in each combination, avoiding duplicate combinations.

    -   After the recursive call, remove the last added number from the `comb` list using `comb.pop()`. This allows us to backtrack and try other numbers for the current position in the combination.

5.  Start the recursion by calling `backtrack(1)` with `start` initially set to 1, as we want to start forming combinations with the numbers from 1 to `n`.

6.  After the recursion is complete, the `res` list will contain all the valid combinations of size `k` formed from the numbers 1 to `n`. Return `res` as the final result.

The code uses a recursive backtracking approach to generate all the combinations efficiently. It explores all possible combinations, avoiding duplicates and forming valid combinations of size `k`. The result `res` will contain all such combinations at the end.

Complexity
==========

-   Time complexity: O(n * k)\
    n is the number of elements and k is the size of the subset. The backtrack function is called n times, because there are n possible starting points for the subset. For each starting point, the backtrack function iterates through all k elements. This is because the comb list must contain all k elements in order for it to be a valid subset.

-   Space complexity: O(k)\
    The comb list stores at most k elements. This is because the backtrack function only adds elements to the comb list when the subset is not yet complete.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combine(int n, int k) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> res;
        std::vector<int> comb;

        backtrack(1, comb, res, n, k);
        return res;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(int start, std::vector<int>& comb, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& res, int n, int k) {
        if (comb.size() == k) {
            res.push_back(comb);
            return;
        }

        for (int num = start; num <= n; num++) {
            comb.push_back(num);
            backtrack(num + 1, comb, res, n, k);
            comb.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
