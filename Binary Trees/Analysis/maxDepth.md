Approach
========

Let me explain 2 ways.

```
       3
     /\
    9     20\
            7
```

Solution 1 - DFS
================

Let's think about subtree with `20` and `7`. From `20`, we have two choice.

-   one is to take depth of left side
-   the other is to take depth of right side

In this case, we should take depth of right side, because

```
max(left, right)
= max(0, 1)
= 1
```

Depth of subtree of `20` and `7` is `2`, but now we have `1` as a maximum depth. This happens because the current node is not yet taken into account. So when we go back to root node(= `3`), the formula should be

```
1 + max(left, right)
= 1 + max(0, 1)
= 2
```

`1` is for current node.\
`max(left, right)` is maximum depth of left or right from a current node.

From node `3`,

```
1 + max(left, right)
= 1 + max(1, 2)
= 3
```

```
return 3
```


Complexity
==========

-   Time complexity: O(n)\
    n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

-   Space complexity: O(h)\
    h is the height of the binary tree. but in the worst case, it can be as large as O(n).

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        }
        return 1 + max(maxDepth(root->left), maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
```

Step by Step Algorithm
======================

#### Step 1: Base Case

-   Code:

    ```
    if not root:
        return 0
    ```

-   If the current node (`root`) is `None`:
    -   Return `0` because an empty subtree has a depth of `0`.

* * * * *

#### Step 2: Recursive Calls

-   Code (integrated with Step 3):

    ```
    return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))
    ```

-   The function makes recursive calls to compute:
    -   The depth of the left subtree (`self.maxDepth(root.left)`).
    -   The depth of the right subtree (`self.maxDepth(root.right)`).

* * * * *

#### Step 3: Compute Maximum Depth

-   After computing the depths of the left and right subtrees:
    -   Use `max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))` to get the maximum depth of the two subtrees.
    -   Add `1` to account for the current node.

Solution 2 - BFS
================

```
①→    3
     /\
②→ 9     20\
③→          7
```

Basically, we iterate through `① → ② → ③`. When we go down to the next level, we will add `+1` to depth.

To do that, we use `queue` initialized with root node.

```
q = [3]
depth = 0
```

Take `3` from queue and check `3` has left child and right child. If it has, add the child to queue.

```
q = [9, 20]

Take 3 and check left and right child. We find 9 and 20
depth = 1
```

Next iteration is `9` and `20` at one time.

```
q = [20]

Take 9 and check left and right child. → No child
depth = 2
```

```
q = [7]

Take 20 and check left and right child. → We find 7
depth = 2
```

Next iteration is `7` at one time.

```
q = []

Take 7 and check left and right child. → No child
depth = 3
```

There is not node in queue.

```
return 3
```

Complexity
==========

-   Time complexity: O(n)\
    n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

-   Space complexity: O(w)\
    w is the maximum width of the tree (worst-case O(n)).

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        }

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int depth = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            depth++;
            int levelSize = q.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                if (node->left) {
                    q.push(node->left);
                }
                if (node->right) {
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
            }
        }

        return depth;
    }
};
```

Step by Step Algorithm
======================

### Step 1: Handle the Base Case

-   Code:

    ```
    if not root:
        return 0
    ```

-   If the input tree is empty (`root` is `None`), return `0` because an empty tree has no depth.

### Step 2: Initialize the BFS Queue

-   Code:

    ```
    q = deque()
    q.append(root)
    depth = 0
    ```

-   Create a queue (`q`) using `deque` to store nodes to be processed.
-   Add the root node to the queue.
-   Initialize `depth` to `0` to track the levels of the tree.

### Step 3: Process Nodes Level by Level

-   Code:

    ```
    while q:
        depth += 1
    ```

-   Start a `while` loop that runs as long as there are nodes in the queue:
    -   Increment the `depth` by `1` for each level of the tree.

### Step 4: Process All Nodes at the Current Level

-   Code:

    ```
    for _ in range(len(q)):
        node = q.popleft()
    ```

-   Use a `for` loop to process all nodes currently in the queue (i.e., nodes at the same level).
-   `len(q)` determines how many nodes are at the current level.
-   Remove a node (`node`) from the front of the queue using `popleft`.

### Step 5: Add the Children of the Current Node

-   Code:

    ```
    if node.left:
        q.append(node.left)
    if node.right:
        q.append(node.right)
    ```

-   If the current node (`node`) has a left child, add it to the queue.
-   If the current node has a right child, add it to the queue.
-   This ensures all nodes at the next level are queued for processing.

### Step 6: Repeat Until the Queue is Empty

-   Continue the `while` loop until all levels of the tree have been processed (i.e., the queue is empty).

### Step 7: Return the Final Depth

-   Code:

    ```
    return depth
    ```

-   Once the queue is empty, all levels of the tree have been processed.
-   Return the value of `depth`, which represents the maximum depth of the tree.
